# AoC2023
 Advent of code in 2023.
 Solutions in 
 - twinBasic
 - Nim
 - any other languages I have a bash at.  

I'm not a professional programmer (and never was).  I worked with technical documents and used Word VBA to a large extent to help massage document formatting.  So programmingwise, mydefault thinking mode is VBA.

My VBA (now twinBasic) solutions generally come first and then translated to other languages, so please don't expect other languages to good idiomatic exmaples.  
Now I'm crinkley and tossed on the scrapheap of life, its more about stopping my brain from fossilising than anything else.
